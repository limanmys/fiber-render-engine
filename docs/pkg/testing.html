<span class="md-text">		Package testing provides support for automated testing of Go packages.
		It is intended to be used in concert with the "go test" command, which automates
		execution of any function of the form
		
			func TestXxx(*testing.T)
		
		where Xxx does not start with a lowercase letter. The function name
		serves to identify the test routine.
		
		Within these functions, use the Error, Fail or related methods to signal failure.
		
		To write a new test suite, create a file whose name ends _test.go that
		contains the TestXxx functions as described here. Put the file in the same
		package as the one being tested. The file will be excluded from regular
		package builds but will be included when the "go test" command is run.
		For more detail, run "go help test" and "go help testflag".
		
		A simple test function looks like this:
		
			func TestAbs(t *testing.T) {
			    got := Abs(-1)
			    if got != 1 {
			        t.Errorf("Abs(-1) = %d; want 1", got)
			    }
			}
		
		# Benchmarks
		
		Functions of the form
		
			func BenchmarkXxx(*testing.B)
		
		are considered benchmarks, and are executed by the "go test" command when
		its -bench flag is provided. Benchmarks are run sequentially.
		
		For a description of the testing flags, see
		https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Testing_flags.
		
		A sample benchmark function looks like this:
		
			func BenchmarkRandInt(b *testing.B) {
			    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {
			        rand.Int()
			    }
			}
		
		The benchmark function must run the target code b.N times.
		During benchmark execution, b.N is adjusted until the benchmark function lasts
		long enough to be timed reliably. The output
		
			BenchmarkRandInt-8   	68453040	        17.8 ns/op
		
		means that the loop ran 68453040 times at a speed of 17.8 ns per loop.
		
		If a benchmark needs some expensive setup before running, the timer
		may be reset:
		
			func BenchmarkBigLen(b *testing.B) {
			    big := NewBig()
			    b.ResetTimer()
			    for i := 0; i &lt; b.N; i++ {
			        big.Len()
			    }
			}
		
		If a benchmark needs to test performance in a parallel setting, it may use
		the RunParallel helper function; such benchmarks are intended to be used with
		the go test -cpu flag:
		
			func BenchmarkTemplateParallel(b *testing.B) {
			    templ := template.Must(template.New("test").Parse("Hello, {{.}}!"))
			    b.RunParallel(func(pb *testing.PB) {
			        var buf bytes.Buffer
			        for pb.Next() {
			            buf.Reset()
			            templ.Execute(&amp;buf, "World")
			        }
			    })
			}
		
		A detailed specification of the benchmark results format is given
		in https://golang.org/design/14313-benchmark-format.
		
		There are standard tools for working with benchmark results at
		https://golang.org/x/perf/cmd.
		In particular, https://golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat performs
		statistically robust A/B comparisons.
		
		# Examples
		
		The package also runs and verifies example code. Example functions may
		include a concluding line comment that begins with "Output:" and is compared with
		the standard output of the function when the tests are run. (The comparison
		ignores leading and trailing space.) These are examples of an example:
		
			func ExampleHello() {
			    fmt.Println("hello")
			    // Output: hello
			}
		
			func ExampleSalutations() {
			    fmt.Println("hello, and")
			    fmt.Println("goodbye")
			    // Output:
			    // hello, and
			    // goodbye
			}
		
		The comment prefix "Unordered output:" is like "Output:", but matches any
		line order:
		
			func ExamplePerm() {
			    for _, value := range Perm(5) {
			        fmt.Println(value)
			    }
			    // Unordered output: 4
			    // 2
			    // 1
			    // 3
			    // 0
			}
		
		Example functions without output comments are compiled but not executed.
		
		The naming convention to declare examples for the package, a function F, a type T and
		method M on type T are:
		
			func Example() { ... }
			func ExampleF() { ... }
			func ExampleT() { ... }
			func ExampleT_M() { ... }
		
		Multiple example functions for a package/type/function/method may be provided by
		appending a distinct suffix to the name. The suffix must start with a
		lower-case letter.
		
			func Example_suffix() { ... }
			func ExampleF_suffix() { ... }
			func ExampleT_suffix() { ... }
			func ExampleT_M_suffix() { ... }
		
		The entire test file is presented as the example when it contains a single
		example function, at least one other function, type, variable, or constant
		declaration, and no test or benchmark functions.
		
		# Fuzzing
		
		'go test' and the testing package support fuzzing, a testing technique where
		a function is called with randomly generated inputs to find bugs not
		anticipated by unit tests.
		
		Functions of the form
		
			func FuzzXxx(*testing.F)
		
		are considered fuzz tests.
		
		For example:
		
			func FuzzHex(f *testing.F) {
			  for _, seed := range [][]byte{{}, {0}, {9}, {0xa}, {0xf}, {1, 2, 3, 4}} {
			    f.Add(seed)
			  }
			  f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, in []byte) {
			    enc := hex.EncodeToString(in)
			    out, err := hex.DecodeString(enc)
			    if err != nil {
			      t.Fatalf("%v: decode: %v", in, err)
			    }
			    if !bytes.Equal(in, out) {
			      t.Fatalf("%v: not equal after round trip: %v", in, out)
			    }
			  })
			}
		
		A fuzz test maintains a seed corpus, or a set of inputs which are run by
		default, and can seed input generation. Seed inputs may be registered by
		calling (*F).Add or by storing files in the directory testdata/fuzz/&lt;Name&gt;
		(where &lt;Name&gt; is the name of the fuzz test) within the package containing
		the fuzz test. Seed inputs are optional, but the fuzzing engine may find
		bugs more efficiently when provided with a set of small seed inputs with good
		code coverage. These seed inputs can also serve as regression tests for bugs
		identified through fuzzing.
		
		The function passed to (*F).Fuzz within the fuzz test is considered the fuzz
		target. A fuzz target must accept a *T parameter, followed by one or more
		parameters for random inputs. The types of arguments passed to (*F).Add must
		be identical to the types of these parameters. The fuzz target may signal
		that it's found a problem the same way tests do: by calling T.Fail (or any
		method that calls it like T.Error or T.Fatal) or by panicking.
		
		When fuzzing is enabled (by setting the -fuzz flag to a regular expression
		that matches a specific fuzz test), the fuzz target is called with arguments
		generated by repeatedly making random changes to the seed inputs. On
		supported platforms, 'go test' compiles the test executable with fuzzing
		coverage instrumentation. The fuzzing engine uses that instrumentation to
		find and cache inputs that expand coverage, increasing the likelihood of
		finding bugs. If the fuzz target fails for a given input, the fuzzing engine
		writes the inputs that caused the failure to a file in the directory
		testdata/fuzz/&lt;Name&gt; within the package directory. This file later serves as
		a seed input. If the file can't be written at that location (for example,
		because the directory is read-only), the fuzzing engine writes the file to
		the fuzz cache directory within the build cache instead.
		
		When fuzzing is disabled, the fuzz target is called with the seed inputs
		registered with F.Add and seed inputs from testdata/fuzz/&lt;Name&gt;. In this
		mode, the fuzz test acts much like a regular test, with subtests started
		with F.Fuzz instead of T.Run.
		
		See https://go.dev/doc/fuzz for documentation about fuzzing.
		
		# Skipping
		
		Tests or benchmarks may be skipped at run time with a call to
		the Skip method of *T or *B:
		
			func TestTimeConsuming(t *testing.T) {
			    if testing.Short() {
			        t.Skip("skipping test in short mode.")
			    }
			    ...
			}
		
		The Skip method of *T can be used in a fuzz target if the input is invalid,
		but should not be considered a failing input. For example:
		
			func FuzzJSONMarshaling(f *testing.F) {
			    f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, b []byte) {
			        var v interface{}
			        if err := json.Unmarshal(b, &amp;v); err != nil {
			            t.Skip()
			        }
			        if _, err := json.Marshal(v); err != nil {
			            t.Error("Marshal: %v", err)
			        }
			    })
			}
		
		# Subtests and Sub-benchmarks
		
		The Run methods of T and B allow defining subtests and sub-benchmarks,
		without having to define separate functions for each. This enables uses
		like table-driven benchmarks and creating hierarchical tests.
		It also provides a way to share common setup and tear-down code:
		
			func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
			    // &lt;setup code&gt;
			    t.Run("A=1", func(t *testing.T) { ... })
			    t.Run("A=2", func(t *testing.T) { ... })
			    t.Run("B=1", func(t *testing.T) { ... })
			    // &lt;tear-down code&gt;
			}
		
		Each subtest and sub-benchmark has a unique name: the combination of the name
		of the top-level test and the sequence of names passed to Run, separated by
		slashes, with an optional trailing sequence number for disambiguation.
		
		The argument to the -run, -bench, and -fuzz command-line flags is an unanchored regular
		expression that matches the test's name. For tests with multiple slash-separated
		elements, such as subtests, the argument is itself slash-separated, with
		expressions matching each name element in turn. Because it is unanchored, an
		empty expression matches any string.
		For example, using "matching" to mean "whose name contains":
		
			go test -run ''        # Run all tests.
			go test -run Foo       # Run top-level tests matching "Foo", such as "TestFooBar".
			go test -run Foo/A=    # For top-level tests matching "Foo", run subtests matching "A=".
			go test -run /A=1      # For all top-level tests, run subtests matching "A=1".
			go test -fuzz FuzzFoo  # Fuzz the target matching "FuzzFoo"
		
		The -run argument can also be used to run a specific value in the seed
		corpus, for debugging. For example:
		
			go test -run=FuzzFoo/9ddb952d9814
		
		The -fuzz and -run flags can both be set, in order to fuzz a target but
		skip the execution of all other tests.
		
		Subtests can also be used to control parallelism. A parent test will only
		complete once all of its subtests complete. In this example, all tests are
		run in parallel with each other, and only with each other, regardless of
		other top-level tests that may be defined:
		
			func TestGroupedParallel(t *testing.T) {
			    for _, tc := range tests {
			        tc := tc // capture range variable
			        t.Run(tc.Name, func(t *testing.T) {
			            t.Parallel()
			            ...
			        })
			    }
			}
		
		Run does not return until parallel subtests have completed, providing a way
		to clean up after a group of parallel tests:
		
			func TestTeardownParallel(t *testing.T) {
			    // This Run will not return until the parallel tests finish.
			    t.Run("group", func(t *testing.T) {
			        t.Run("Test1", parallelTest1)
			        t.Run("Test2", parallelTest2)
			        t.Run("Test3", parallelTest3)
			    })
			    // &lt;tear-down code&gt;
			}
		
		# Main
		
		It is sometimes necessary for a test or benchmark program to do extra setup or teardown
		before or after it executes. It is also sometimes necessary to control
		which code runs on the main thread. To support these and other cases,
		if a test file contains a function:
		
			func TestMain(m *testing.M)
		
		then the generated test will call TestMain(m) instead of running the tests or benchmarks
		directly. TestMain runs in the main goroutine and can do whatever setup
		and teardown is necessary around a call to m.Run. m.Run will return an exit
		code that may be passed to os.Exit. If TestMain returns, the test wrapper
		will pass the result of m.Run to os.Exit itself.
		
		When TestMain is called, flag.Parse has not been run. If TestMain depends on
		command-line flags, including those of the testing package, it should call
		flag.Parse explicitly. Command line flags are always parsed by the time test
		or benchmark functions run.
		
		A simple implementation of TestMain is:
		
			func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
				// call flag.Parse() here if TestMain uses flags
				os.Exit(m.Run())
			}
		
		TestMain is a low-level primitive and should not be necessary for casual
		testing needs, where ordinary test functions suffice.</span>
